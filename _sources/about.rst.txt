I am a cognitive scientist from Sweden with an interest in the intersection of technology and human cognition. I started my academic journey in philosophy, where studies in the philosophy of mind and language made me intrested in the connection between language and thought. This made me study linguistics for a year, eventually sparking my interest in cognitive science. After receiving my Bachelor degree in theoretical philosophy, I started my graduate studies in cognitive science.

Cognitive science as a field of study is multidiciplinary, involving computer science, linguistics, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and even anthropology (an often forgotten discipline in cognitive science). All of these disciplines interest me deeply, but shortly after starting my studies in cognitive science I found a specific interest in the intersection between technology, cognition, and language. Therefore, my academic work has mostly focused on the cognitive processes involved in writing and reading while using technology. My current goal, after now having recievied my Master's degree, is to get a job aligned with my interests where I can apply the expertise I have acquired during my education.

When using technology, we read a lot, and this text also needs to be written clearly. The goal of language is communication, but this goal is not always successful. You don't need to be a cognitive scientist to write clearly; however, it helps to understand what makes text comprehensible to a reader. Easily readable and comprehensible text is crucial when interacting with technology, ensuring it is used properly and as intended, especially when dealing with potentially dangerous situations. This is where my experience shines. With a deep understanding of writing and reading processes, as well as the cognitive resources used while interacting with technology, I aim to make technology easier to understand and use.

Not all of my interests revolve around what I have studied however. I am an avid reader, interested in science fiction and classic literature. I also love movies and art. Before deciding to study philosophy, linguistics or cognitive science, I wanted to be an animator (or a graphic designer). In my childhood I made many stop motion animation films using Lego. Some of these are `accessible online <https://www.youtube.com/@CableAnimStudios>`_ (keep in mind that i was between 12 and 13 years old when I made them). I later studied animation and graphic design in high school and wanted to study animation after graduation. But since I had developed an interest in philosophy in my free time, I decided to take a course in theoretical philosophy to see if I would like it as much in an academic setting â€“ which I of course did.
