How to use GenoGraphiX-LOG to write and analyze a text
======================================================

In this short guide I will go through how to write a text in the keystroke logging software GenoGraphiX-LOG, as well as how to start analyzing a writing session. Before I start with the guide itself, I will begin with a short introduction to what kind of software GenoGraphiX-LOG is and why you might want to use it. If you want to go straight into how to use the program, then go to the section `How to use GenoGraphiX-LOG`_.

What is GenoGraphiX-LOG?
========================

GenoGraphiX-LOG (abbreviated GGXLog) is a program that records the keys you press on your keyboard while writing—what is called *keystroke logging*. You might be familiar with what are sometimes called keyloggers as malicious software used to steal confidential information. A hacker might use a covertly installed keylogger on a victims computer to steal their login information. This is *not* what GGXLog is used for nor can it be used in that way.

The keystroke logging software GGXLog is primarily used for writing research. It is the software I used to investigate :ref:`the writing processes of high school students <first_year_masters_thesis>` when taking a language test, as well as when I explored :ref:`how academics used AI-assistance <second_year_masters_thesis>` to write short academic texts.

GGXLog records each keystroke that is pressed when writing in the program, and then compiles and stores the data into files with a tab-separated value (.tsv) format. As an example, here is the log for "GGXLog records each keystroke" from the previous sentence in a spreadsheet:

.. csv-table::
   :file: table_output.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: small-table

The sheer amount of data that keystroke logging provides becomes clear in this example. However, because of the inaccessible format of the log, GGXLog also offers several features for analysis. Furthermore, the log can be loaded into statistical software.

Why use a keystroke logger?
---------------------------

Beyond recording *what* key you press on the keyboard, it also records *when* you press the key. This gives you the pause length between each character, word, sentence, and paragraph of your text. The length of the pause as well as where the pause occurs can tell you a lot about writing processes:

* Longer pauses between characters can indicate spelling difficulties (orthographic processing),

* Longer pauses between words can indicate struggling to think of a word (lexical retrieval),

* Longer pauses between sentences can indicate planning of the next sentence or evaluation of the previous sentence (higher-order processing),

* Longer pauses between paragraphs can indicate organizing the overall text (also higher-order processing).

These processes are *cognitive*—that is, they indicate some mental activity. For cognitive processes, we typically look for pauses above 2 seconds, what is called a *cognitive pause*. So a pause above 2 seconds within a word might be indicative of spelling difficulties. 

.. note:: The 2-second threshold is backed up by research and generally accepted. However, what threshold should be used can differ depending on context and the writers themselves. When to use what threshold will not be discussed here.

Additionally, cognitive processes are not the only type of writing process you can investigate with GGXLog. Pauses can say a lot of things, but deletions are also recorded since keystroke loggers record every pressed key (including backspace and selections with the mouse). We can therefore see changes in the texts, what are called revisions, making the text's evolution over time visible.

Who should use a keystroke logger?
----------------------------------

There are many different reasons to write with a keystroke logger and, therefore, many different people that would find it useful.

**Researchers** have used keystroke logging to study different peoples writing processes for some time now.

**Teachers** can use keystroke logging to get a better view of student's writing abilities and their progress. Additionally, :ref:`I investigated <first_year_masters_thesis>` its use for teachers to gain a more nuanced perspective of their students' performances on tests.

**Clinicians** can use keystroke logging to detect writing difficulties that occur because of certain neuropsychiatric disorders. `Recent studies <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11865-7>`_ have even shown keystroke logging to be useful to detect early stages of dementia that are difficult to diagnose with traditional diagnostic measures.

**Students** or **writers** of any type might want to know more about how they write texts themselves, what they struggle with, what they spend the most time doing when writing, how much their text evolves, or what their writing process looks like.

How to use GenoGraphiX-LOG
==========================

Now you know what a keystroke logger is and who might want to use it and what one would use it for. In this section I will cover how to use the keystroke logging program to write a text and analyze the writing session.

In the section "How to write a text with GenoGraphiX-LOG" I will cover the basics of the program, including how to create a project and start the writing session. There are multiple project types, but I will only cover what is called "Free-writing". In this project type the user has access to one window where they are free to write anything they want. Another type of project is "Translating", where the user is presented with two windows—one with a text that is to be translated, and another with a bank page where the translated text is to be written. There are different types of projects for different uses, but Free-writing is probably the most common type of project.

Next, in the section "How to analyze a text with GenoGraphiX-LOG", I will briefly cover how to analyze the texts with some—not all—analysis tools that GGXLog has to offer, and how to extract your entire log and specific data in a software like Excel. I will give a brief introduction to what type of statistics can be viewed natively in GGXLog, but I will *not* give a detailed guide on how to interpret the data that GGXLog gives you.

How to write a text with GenoGraphiX-LOG
----------------------------------------

Step 1: Installing the program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To write using GGXLog, you first need to have the program installed on your computer. The program can be downloaded at the website `ggxlog.net <https://www.ggxlog.net/>`_. Go to the "Downloads" section on the website and download the version for your operating system.

   :align: center

You will have to register to download the program by entering your name, email, country, as well as eventual university affiliation and research project. You do not have to give accurate information, you will be able to download the program immediately after registering anyway.

   :align: center

.. important:: Your antivirus software or system security might flag the software as potential malware. This is because GGXLog logs your keystrokes when you are using the program. In that case you will have to give GGXLog permission to run anyway.

.. seealso:: If you need more guidance on how to install GGXLog, you can follow the installation instructions on the `user support section <https://www.ggxlog.net/usersupport.html>`_ on the GGXlog website.

Step 2: Creating a new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you have GGXLog installed, you will have to start a new project. To do this, open the program and navigate to the top bar and press "Project", and then "New".

A window will appear with two subsections—one subsection called "Project Settings" and another subsection called "Informant Information".

.. image:: /_static/ggxlog_project.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

The project settings section includes settings for your project, such as the previously mentioned project types, the expected session length if you want a real time graph, and where you want to save your project

For a project where you write a text such as an essay, short story, or another similar text, you should select "Free-writing" as the project type. The "Session length" setting is only relevant if you want to display the real-time graph when you write. Select "Long text" unless you know that your writing session will last for less than 10 minutes. To choose where to save your project folder, press the brows button by the "File Save Location" setting.

   :scale: 75%

.. note:: The real-time graph is not recommended for new users. The graph is difficult to understand and might be distracting.

The informant information section is for research purposes. In this section, the participant can provide general demographic information. It also contains an informed consent form for the participant.

   :scale: 75%

When you have are done setting up your project, press "Continue" at the bottom right of the window to create the project.

Step 3: Start writing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you will be presented with the writing interface consisting of a few buttons—a record button, a greyed out stop and save button, and a close button—as well as the text editor where you will write your text below the buttons.

.. image:: /_static/ggxlog_session.png
   :align: center

To begin the writing session press "Record". The text editor will unlock and turn white, which means that are able to start writing your text.

.. image:: /_static/ggxlog_record.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 75%

When you have started the writing session and are recording, what previously was the record button will become a pause button. Pressing the pause button will pause the recording and the text editor will be locked again.

.. image:: /_static/ggxlog_pause.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 75%

When you have finished your writing session press "Stop and Save" to stop the writing session and save your session. You will be asked to confirm your choice. When confirmed, the program will tell you where the project was saved, which will be the destination you chose when setting up the project.
