======================================
Welcome to Andreas Sellstone's Website
======================================

This is my personal website where you can find information about me and my work.

I am a cognitive scientist seeking new professional opportunities. My primary interest lies in exploring how people interact with technology, particularly focusing on how different cognitive processes are involved, and how behavioral insights can be leveraged to develop more effective and user centered technology. While most of my academic projects have focused on language use in these interactions, my research interests extend beyond this area. Check out my :ref:`portfolio <portfolio>` to view the projects I have worked on.

If you would like to know more about me you can go to the :ref:`about section <about>`.

View my portfolio
=================

In my portfolio you can find projects (academic, professional, and personal) ranging from technical writing, UX-design, and research. Although diverse, my projects find common ground in the application of cognitive science to the use and development of technology.

Here you can view my portfolio of different projects I have pursued:

Read my blog
============

In my blog you will be able to (it is a work in progress) find writings on diverse subjects, ranging from film, cognitive science, philosophy, technology, and other things that I find interesting. I enjoy writing, and this is where I can write about things that might not be related to my professional work.

Here you will be able to (again, work in progress) find my blog posts where I write about various subjects that I find interesting:
