Welcome to Andreas Sellstone's Website
======================================

This is my personal website where you can find information about me and my work, including my :ref:`portfolio <portfolio>` and :ref:`blog <blog>`.

Who am I? I am a cognitive scientist looking for work. I'm interested in the ways people interact with technology, particularly (but not exclusively) in how language is used in these interactions. There are a number of professions relating to cognition and technology that I am interested in pursuing, but as of right now I would especially like to pursue Technical Writing. However, I am almost equally interested in Data Analysis, Human Factors Engineering, and UX-Design/Research.

If you would like to know more about me you can go to the :ref:`about section <about>`.

View my portfolio
-----------------

In my portfolio you can find projects (academic, professional, and personal) ranging from technical writing, coding, UX-design, and research in cognitive science. Although diverse, my projects find common ground in the application of cognitive science to the use and development of technology.

Read my blog
------------

In my blog you will be able to (it is a work in progress) find writings on diverse subjects, ranging from film, cognitive science, philosophy, technology, and other things that I find interesting. I enjoy writing, and this is where I can write about things that might not be related to my professional work.
